# Crystal Nexus Exchange - Quantum Storage Protocol

## Overview
Crystal Nexus Exchange is a sophisticated digital resource allocation system based on temporal constraints. It implements a quantum-inspired storage and transfer framework where "crystals" represent energy units that can be transmitted, reverted, stabilized, and reclaimed under predefined rules. The protocol enforces security through permission layers, decay mechanisms, and anomaly detection.

## Features
- **Secure Energy Transmission**: Crystals can be transferred between originators and beneficiaries.
- **Temporal Constraints**: Stability period enforces controlled decay and resource management.
- **Anomaly Detection & Resolution**: Mechanisms for reporting and balancing quantum anomalies.
- **Permissioned Operations**: Protocol supervisor oversight for administrative actions.

## Smart Contract Implementation
The protocol is implemented in Clarity, a decidable smart contract language. Key functions include:

### Core Functions
- **`finalize-energy-transmission`** - Transfers crystal energy to the beneficiary.
- **`revert-crystal-energy`** - Redirects crystal energy back to the originator.
- **`dissolve-crystal`** - Allows originators to dissolve crystals.
- **`extend-crystal-stability`** - Extends the stability period of a crystal.
- **`reclaim-decayed-crystal`** - Reclaims energy from decayed crystals.
- **`report-lattice-anomaly`** - Reports an anomaly in the crystal lattice.
- **`register-quantum-signature`** - Registers a quantum signature for security validation.
- **`balance-quantum-anomaly`** - Resolves anomalies by redistributing energy.

## Installation & Deployment
To deploy the Crystal Nexus Exchange protocol, follow these steps:

1. Install Clarity development tools:
   ```sh
   npm install -g @stacks/cli
   ```
2. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrystalNexusExchange.git
   cd CrystalNexusExchange
   ```
3. Deploy the contract using Stacks CLI:
   ```sh
   stacks deploy contract.clar --network testnet
   ```
4. Interact with the contract using Clarity REPL.

## Usage
Users can interact with the smart contract through a blockchain explorer or directly via Clarity CLI. Functions require appropriate permissions and must adhere to the lattice state rules.
